        <h2>Why I'm doing this</h2>
        <p>There's just no place to get first hand information about Sri Lanka Railways aside from maybe some private forums.
          For example, if I wanted to get a picture of a specific rail coach, I can't because there's nowhere to get that.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-block">
        <h2>What I will be doing</h2>
        <p>I will be observing every train I take more than the average person at least.
          I'm also trying to get my hands on some amazing books about SLR to get more information about what I see.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-block">
        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <p>For those who make 3D models, want to study SLR or just love trains a little too much.
          Especially those who love model trains but don't have a reliable place to get reference images, dimensions, etc.</p>
