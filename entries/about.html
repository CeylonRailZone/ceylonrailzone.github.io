          <p><strong>Ceylon RailZone</strong> is a digital archive dedicated to the rich and evolving world of Sri Lanka Railways.
            From the earliest steam locomotives to modern-day diesel units, this project aims to document every class, line, and story
            that has defined the island’s rail network through time.</p>
          <p>The site serves as both an educational reference and a visual showcase for enthusiasts, historians, and anyone interested
            in understanding how rail transport shaped Sri Lanka’s development.</p>

          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>The goal of Ceylon RailZone is to preserve information and visuals of Sri Lanka’s trains and rail infrastructure,
            making them easily accessible to everyone. Many locomotives and units that once ran across the country have now vanished,
            this project ensures their legacy isn’t forgotten.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide detailed pages on every train class and route.</li>
            <li>Showcase photos, 360° views, and technical details.</li>
            <li>Offer educational insights into rail technology and history.</li>
          </ul>
