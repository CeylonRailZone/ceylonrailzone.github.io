      <h1>Carriages</h1>
      <p>This DEMU comes with 2nd class and 3rd class carriages, both used for commuter service and long distance travel. 
        These come in sets,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Driver power car</li>
        <li>3 3rd class carriages</li>
        <li>1 2nd class carriage</li>
        <li>1 Driver trailer car</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The power car may be at the front pulling the train or at the back pushing everything.
      Two of these sets can be chained togather with power cars facing away in a way that allows one power car to push while the other pulls.
      This is mostly done on busy hours to help with the crowd.</p>

      <h1>Facilities</h1>
      <h3>2nd Class</h3>
      <p>
        2nd Class of Class S11 set offers comfortable, well padded front facing seats in a 2+2 layout.
        There are armrests that can be moved away for accessibility.
        There is a fan for every set of seats, that's controllable from the switches next to the windows.
        Back of every seat gets a reclinable table and a small sac to put your small stuff, as well as racks for your bigger bags. 
        Even though there are still fluorescent lamps, there are crudely placed LED lamps that give off a dim ambiance.
        Doors are manual as usual and an unusually high amount of steel beams and grabhandles.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">3rd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Third class comes with stiff seats that share a backrest with the one behind in a 3+2 layout.
        Because of this nature, a group of 6 can basically sit in a circle.
        Other than that, lighting is similar to 2nd class but fans are significantly spaced apart.
        You get basic grabhandles and a small rack to but your big bags into.

      <h1>Liveries</h1>
      <p>
        First batch of these sets were red, blue and white while the other batch that SLR received in 2012 was completely red.
        Eventually all those train sets were painted the plain pink/red color. 
        There are also some sets that have a similar design to the old red and blue livery, just without the blue, and grey instead of the white,
        Which results in this unfinished paint look.
