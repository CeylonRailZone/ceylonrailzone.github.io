      <p>Class S12 is a DEMU built by CSR Corporation and imported to Sri Lanka in the year 2012.
      They were built to replace locomotive-hauled passenger trains. 
        Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main line from Colombo to Badulla. Four of S12s were built to serve the Kelani Valley Line. The remaining sets were designed to be luxury.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Railways_S12">[Wikipedia]</a></p>

      <h1>Carriages</h1>
      <p>It's a normal thing for SLR to attach whatever carriages they have and call it a day. But I have observed some of these and compiled roughly how the carriages are set up.</p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Main line set</h3>
      <p>This train set is used in the main line, as the name suggests.
      This used to run as the Udarata Manike and Podi Manike before the more modern class S14 sets took over. It comes with,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Driver power cars on either sides</li>
        <li>3 3rd class carriages</li>
        <li>1 3rd class buffet carriage</li>
        <li>3 2nd class carriages</li>
        <li>1 Air conditioned 1st class carriage</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Kelani Valley line set</h3>
      <p>This train set is used in the kelani valley line (although it may be used anywhere nowadays), as the name suggests. It comes with,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Driver power car</li>
        <li>5 3rd specially designed carriages</li>
        <li>1 Driver trailer car</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Luxury set</h3>
      <p>I have not been able to find much information about it. It's possible though not confirmed that this set has 4 air conditioned first class carriages and 4 second class carriages.</p>

      <h1>Facilities</h1>
      <h3 >1st Class Air Conditioned</h3>
      <p>
        1st class of this train offers comfortable reclining seats in a 2+2 layout with retractable foot rests.
        There are armrests that can be moved away for accessibility.
        Every seat gets a retractable table or a cup holder, and a sac to put small stuff into.
        Obviously there are no fans as this is an air conditioned class. 
        There are LCD screens that shows information about the train speed, current location and much more.
        Windows are not openable and the door is touch activated, though you can open it even when the train is moving.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">2nd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Seating layout is similar to that of the first class, just with slightly less comfortable seating. Seats can face forward or backwards.
        You get a retractable table or a cup holder but no sac like first class, you can use the storage racks above to keep your bags.
        More than enough steel beams and grabhandles are present indicating use in commuter service.
        There is a lavatory in the middle of the carriage as this is used in long journies.
        There are fans for ventilation but they are not really necessary as the windows open.
      </p>

    <div class="description-text">
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">3rd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to 2nd class except a huge downgrade in seating. You get stiff seats in a 3+2 layout where you share a backrest with the seat behind you.
        Seats cannot be reclined due to the nature of this design so you will be sitting at a 90deg angle.
        You get a small surface to keep small things that you will have to share with 6 or 4 people.
        Since there are face to face seats, a group of maximum 6 people can sit in a "circle" so this is the train if you're into that.

      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">3rd Class (Kelani Valley)</h3>
      <p>
        Seating is similar to that of any other commuter service. It priorotises functionality over comfort. With rows of hard plastic seating facing inwards. (Similar to the ones of Class S13 in the image below)
        You have plenty of space to stand up, as designed. Steel beams and grabhandles helps with balance while standing.
        There are Gangways in between cars so you can move between them without getting out of the train.
        There is basic LED lighting and some fans which don't work half the time.
        Doors are also manual as usual in South Asian trains. 
        There are storage racks to put small bags in at busy hours.
        Train journies on this will last at most 2 hours but lavatories are not available.

      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Buffet</h3>
      <p>
        It's more of a junk food cart that a buffet, so don't get excited yet. 
        You can get popcorn, chips and some water and nothing else.

      <h1>Routes</h1>
      <p>
        Routes are pretty obvious by the names. The main line set covers the main line and the kelani valley line set covers that.
        Before the introduction of the class S14, this DEMU used to run as the Udarata Manike and Podi Manike services.
      </p>
      <p  style="margin-top:20px;">Currently, this train pulls two express services on the main line,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tikiri Manike (Cute Maiden)</li>
        <li>Kandy Office Express Train</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Liveries</h1>
      <p>
        The class S12 set comes in a blue color, getting the nickname "Blue Train". Some sources state the Kelani valley version has a slightly lighter blue color but I can't find any proof mostly because colors appear differently at different times of the day, making comparisons difficuilt.
