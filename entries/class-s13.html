      <p>Class S13 is a DEMU built by the Integral Coach Factory, India and imported to Sri Lanka in the year 2018.
      Later in 2019, Sri Lanka Railways ordered another two fully Air-conditioned DEMU train sets designated as the Class S13A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Railways_S13">[Wikipedia]</a></p>

      <h3>Class S13</h3>
      <p>This DEMU comes with different class carrieges in different formations,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 x Driver power car</li>
        <li>4/5/6 x any class carriages according to demand</li>
        <li>1 Driver trailer car</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The power car may be at the front pulling the train or at the back pushing everything.
      Two of these sets can be chained togather with power cars facing away in a way that allows one power car to push while the other pulls.
      This is mostly done on busy hours to help with the crowd.</p>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Class S13A</h3>
      <p>This is a luxury train set that only consists of air conditioned first class carrieges. The formation is as follows,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 x Driver power cars at each end</li>
        <li>10 x Air conditioned First Class carrieges</li>
        <li>1 x Restaurant + Guard carriege in the middle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In real world, both of these power car types are mixed together, but the luxury train still runs.</p>

      <h3>1st Class Air Conditioned</h3>
      <p>
        1st class of this train offers comfortable reclining seats in a 2+2 layout with retractable foot rests.
        There are armrests that can be moved away for accessibility.
        Every seat gets a retractable table or a cup holder, and a sac to put small stuff into.
        Obviously there are no fans as this is an air conditioned class. 
        There are LCD screens that shows information about the train speed, current location and much more.
        If you want to listen to the broadcast, intercom or music, you can plug your wired headphones into the port on the seat, which conviniently offers a 10W USB A port to charge your electronics.
        You can also use the UK power outlet near the footrests to plug your own power brick.
        Windows are not openable and the door is touch activated, though you can open it even when the train is moving.
        There are blinds in the windows in case the sunlight is coming inside.
        This class lacks any racks to put your bags into.

      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">2nd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Seating layout is similar to that of the first class, just with slightly less comfortable seating. 
        You get a retractable table or a cup holder but no sac like first class, you can use the storage racks above to keep your bags.
        The LCD screens are also here but less of them are available per car.
        More than enough grabhandles are present indicating use in commuter service.
        There is a lavatory in the middle of the carriage as this is used in long journies.
        There are fans for ventilation but they are not really necessary as the windows open. Doors are manual as usual.

    <div class="description-text">
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">3rd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to 2nd class except a huge downgrade in seating. You get stiff seats in a 3+2 layout where you share a backrest with the seat behind you.
        Seats cannot be reclined due to the nature of this design, so you will be sitting at a 90deg angle.
        Since there are face to face seats, a group of maximum 6 people can sit in a "circle" so this is the train if you're into that.

      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Buffet</h3>
      <p>
        It's more of a junk food cart that a buffet, so don't get excited yet. 
        You can get popcorn, chips and some water and nothing else.

        PIS is an information system that shows the current location, next location, current route and other useful informations in the
        video form on small LCD displays as well as Audio from small speakers at every carriege. 1st class gets an exclusive entertaintment
        system with football games / movies on small displays in the middle of the carriege and the ends of it.
