      Later in 2020, Sri Lanka Railways got another 4 power cars as Class S14A. This is the latest DEMU in the SLR fleet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Railways_S14">[Wikipedia]</a></p>

      <h1>Facilities</h1>
      <h3>1st Class Air Conditioned</h3>
      <p>
        1st class of this train offers comfortable reclining seats in a 2+2 layout with retractable foot rests.
        There are armrests that can be moved away for accessibility.
        Every seat gets a retractable table or a cup holder, and a sac to put small stuff into.
        Obviously there are no fans as this is an air conditioned class. 
        There are LCD screens that shows information about the train speed, current location and much more.
        If you want to listen to the broadcast, intercom or music, you can plug your wired headphones into the port on the seat, which conviniently offers a 10W USB A port to charge your electronics.
        You can also use the UK power outlet near the footrests to plug your own power brick.
        Windows are not openable and the door is touch activated, though you can open it even when the train is moving.
        There are blinds in the windows in case the sunlight is coming inside.
        This class lacks any racks to put your bags into.
      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">2nd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Seating layout is similar to that of the first class, just with slightly less comfortable seating. 
        You get a retractable table or a cup holder but no sac like first class, you can use the storage racks above to keep your bags.
        More than enough grabhandles are present indicating use in commuter service.
        There is a lavatory in the middle of the carriage as this is used in long journies.
        There are fans for ventilation but they are not really necessary as the windows open. Doors are manual as usual.
      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">3rd Class</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to 2nd class except a huge downgrade in seating. You get stiff padded seats in a 3+2 layout where you share a backrest with the seat behind you.
        Seats cannot be reclined due to the nature of this design so you will be sitting at a 90deg angle.
        Since there are face to face seats, a group of maximum 6 people can sit in a "circle" so this is the train if you're into that.
        The 6/4 people group gets a small tray connected to the wall to place small objects.

      <h3>Class S14</h3>
      <p>
        The class S14 comes in a blue, pink and white design that looks nice in the greenery of the Main line.
      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Class S14A</h3>
      <p>Class S14A is a series of power cars imported later in 2020 in a green and white livery for the Aruwakkalu Waste Processing Facility under the Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Project.
      The project eventually came to a halt and the power cars were put into passenger service along with the original passenger carriages.</p>
