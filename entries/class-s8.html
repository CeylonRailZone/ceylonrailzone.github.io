      <h1>Carriages</h1>
      <p>The Class S8 DMU only has 3rd class carriages as it is mostly used for commuter services.
        These come in sets,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Driver power car</li>
        <li>4 Third class carrieges</li>
        <li>1 Driver trailer car</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The power car may be at the front pulling the train or at the back pushing everything.
      Two of these sets can be chained togather with power cars facing away in a way that allows one power car to push while the other pulls.
      This is mostly done on busy hours to help with the crowd.</p>

      <h1>Facilities</h1>
      <p>
        Being a commuter service, The seating layout priorotises functionality over comfort. With rows of hard plastic seating facing inwards.
        You have plenty of space to stand up, as designed. Steel beams helps you hold on while standing although grabhandles aren't present.
        There are no Gangways in between cars so you cannot move between them without getting out of the train.
        There is basic LED lighting and some fans which don't work half the time.
        Doors are also manual as usual in South Asian trains. 
        There are storage racks to put small bags in at busy hours.
        Train journies on this will last at most 2 hours but lavatories are not available.
        Overall pretty torn out but gets the job done.
