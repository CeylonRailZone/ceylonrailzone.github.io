      <h1>Carriages</h1>
      <p>This DEMU is used only for commuter service and only has 3rd class carrieges for that reason.
        These come in sets,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Driver power car</li>
        <li>4 3rd class carrieges</li>
        <li>1 Driver trailer car</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The power car may be at the front pulling the train or at the back pushing everything.
      Two of these sets can be chained togather with power cars facing away in a way that allows one power car to push while the other pulls.
      This is mostly done on busy hours to help with the crowd.</p>

      <h1>Facilities</h1>
      <p>
        Being a commuter service, The seating layout priorotises functionality over comfort. With rows of hard plastic seating facing inwards.
        You have plenty of space to stand up, as designed. Steel beams helps with balance while standing although no grabhandles are present.
        There are Gangways in between cars so you can move between them without getting out of the train.
        There is basic LED lighting and some fans which don't work half the time. In fact, one of the LEDs on the example image is not working.
        Doors are also manual as usual in South Asian trains. 
        There are storage racks to put small bags in at busy hours.
        Train journies on this will last at most 2 hours but lavatories are not available.
        Overall gets the job done.

      <h1>Liveries</h1>
      <p>The Class S9 locomotive has a unique blue, yellow, white and grey livery.
        But the yellow strip on most driver cars has been painted red as their computer system was improved.
        The grey has a bluish tint making it really hard do distinguish from the blue.
      But there is indeed a differemce.
