        Most of the Sri Lanka's Railway infrastructure was damaged and is in inoperable condition after the catertrophic Cyclone Ditwah.
        It has caused many landslides, floods and heavy winds resulting in Railway Washaways, Bridge collapses and debris on the tracks.
        While these may seem simple to get back and running, It is a difficuilt task especially in the Upcountry line due to the rough terrain of the area.
